// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step you analyze what needs to be done and how much time and recourses it will take."
const design = "This step requires being able to take the planning and analysis of requirements step and make them a reality by typing the code and making sure things look like they should."
const implementation = "Once the product or code has been 'designed' it must be placed into it's final or intended state so that the user can... well... use it."
const testingAndIntegration  = "Now that the code has been implemented a lot of test need to be run to make sure there are no bugs and that it is functioning properly."
const maintain = "If all steps previous to this have been done correctly maintaining the code will still be a process of continued tests, checking links, helping users, and at times starting the process over again."
