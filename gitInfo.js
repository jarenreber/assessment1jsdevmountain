/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = "Git is a program that allows once to save work history locally on a computer allowing that user to see past versions of their code. There is a main branch and limbs allowing there to be the main code and tests."
//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is a program that saves remote repositories or a remote location to store code so that a computer crash will not wipe all of your past work. Using git one can push up to GitHub saving their work in a remote location. This is also useful as it allows multiple users to work on the same project and see version histories of the code."
//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitInitDefinition = "git init is a console command that creates a local repository and starts the process of tracking the file you initialize."
//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitCloneDefinition = "A git clone is simply a copy of the existing repository."
//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitStatusDefinition = "Git status is an easy way for one to be able to get a status of what their repository is looking like. Showing things like if there are new changes to commit or if there has even been an initialization."
//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitAddDefinition = "Git add is a command that directs Git to save a version of the current code."
let gitAddCode = "git add ."
//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitCommitDefinition = "Git commit similar to git add is what the command after git add. Once code as been added a commit will take a hard snapshot of the code and prep it to be pushed to the remote repo."
let gitCommitCode = 'git commit -m "initial commit"'
//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitPushDefinition = "Git push is what you do when you are ready to push or send the code to the remote repository, such as GitHub, where the files will be stored."
